Kettle Project is a palm sized game platform made with raspberry pico 2.

It has 1.3inch oled screen, 1000mAh or 450mAh battery, 2 shoulder buttons, a joystick (5 buttons), charging circuit and a regular switch.

My idea was how small I could make such a project and make it decent. Maybe I will print my own pcb if importing pcbs were NOT a problem.
I mean it's cool. 

Code is open source. Cheers.
